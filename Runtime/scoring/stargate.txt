A special undocumented bonus can be gained by dropping off a humanoid as the last event in a wave. There are 2 ways to do this. One way requires you to have killed everything off in the wave except for one lander. Wait for the lander to pick up a humanoid. Shoot the lander and catch the humanoid JUST before it hits the ground. The other way is to deposit a humanoid that your ship is carrying at the exact moment when you kill the last enemy of the wave. Either way, when this is done properly the screen will flash several times and you will be awarded 2,000 points.

* Bonus at the end of each wave

Wave 2 : Humanoids Left X 200.
Wave 3 : Humanoids Left X 300.
Wave 4 : Humanoids Left X 400.
Wave 5 and all Yllabian Dogfight waves : 2,500 points.
Wave 6 and above : Humaniods Left X 500.
Warp : Humanoids Left X 2,000.
